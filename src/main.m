    This will be the main script in which the SDR (being written) will be
    ran. 

    To-Do:

    1) Verify updated acquisition works (I am confident it will but this

    2) DLL Class

    3) Tracking Channel Class

    4) Verify PLL Class is working

    5) Cn0 Estimator

    6) Software Defined Receiver Class
